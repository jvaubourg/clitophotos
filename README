[Manual]

  Just put your photos in an img/ directory, and this index.html file in the parent directory.
  Your webserver has to have the +Indexes directive (directory listing) enabled at least for img/.

  For the photo gallery of an event named "event_name" (https://example.com/event_name/), you should have:
    % ls event_name/
    index.html img

  Before uploading:

    - Resizing:
       % for i in myPhotos/*; do convert $i -resize 1024x1024 event_name/img/$(basename $i); done 
    - Rotating:
       % exiftran -ai event_name/img/*
    - Reordering: 
       With Geeqie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jI0BiaQzmms
       (use drag and drop or sort by Exif-date, before renaming)
    - Cleaning metadata:
       % exiftool -overwrite_original -all= event_name/img/*
