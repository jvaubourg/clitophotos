[Manual]

  Just put your photos in an img/ directory, and this index.html file in the parent directory.
  Your webserver has to have the +Indexes directive (directory listing) enabled at least for img/.

  For the photo gallery of an event named "eventName" (https://example.com/eventName/), you should have:
    % ls eventName/
    index.html img

  Resizing and rotating:
    % for i in myPhotos/*; do convert $i -resize 1024x1024 eventName/img/$(basename $i); done 
    % exiftran -ai eventName/img/*
